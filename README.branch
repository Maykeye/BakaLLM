This branch contains previous iteration of BakaNet(working title) that I described in my devto blog, but never released.
It's still technically more "half of source available" as scripts like maykio and maykds responspible for bunch of utils
are not present.
In particular, iterator differs from `pristine` that it injected BOS every batch.
This behavior is too much similar to attention sink, therefore it was removed from `pristine` branch which is a new baseline.
This branch also contains scripts that was used to cleanup wikitext103 in pre-pristine era.
Now instead of cleaned  https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikitext (more specifically https://s3.amazonaws.com/research.metamind.io/wikitext/wikitext-103-raw-v1.zip") iohadrubin/wikitext-103-raw-v1 is used
